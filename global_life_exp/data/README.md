## Purpose of this **README.md**

This file expands any acronyms or shorthand `str`that the author use to sort, categorise the variuos sources of the data in each folder.

Also, it describes any none-obvious file or folder names in this data folder.

Lastly, it provides the links for all the data source to enable automation of the process of sourcing data (by reading directly from the source databases (url)) once I get the required skills to do so.
