# Purpose: To Document Session 213

Although I went ahead and did sessions 217 >, which advances this session (C213), I will go ahead and work through this one to have a order in my quest to ***"Take a peek into the mind of an R maestro"!*** Preferably, I will handle this one by myself! That is, without checking the video by the Prof!

# The Dataset

```{r}
read.csv("/home/iamlnx/Documents/GitHub/nasoma_R/climate/data/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv", skip = 1, na = "***")
```
